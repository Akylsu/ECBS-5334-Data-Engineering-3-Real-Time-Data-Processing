## Syllabus

    Data Engineering 3: Real-Time Data Processing

**Prerequisites:** 

> Data Analysis 1: Exploration – Business Analytics track;
> Data Analysis 2: Finding Patterns with Regressions – Business Analytics track;
> Data Engineering 2: Big Data and Cloud Computing

**Course description**
In this course, you will learn which are the underlying concepts of real-time data processing systems. You
will get an introduction of different technologies you can employ to solve real-time use-cases with a
special focus on Amazon Web Services and Apache Spark 

**Learning outcomes** 
By the end of the course you will:
- Understand the building blocks of a real-time data infrastructure
- Understand the caveats that arise when you take these systems to production
- You will have hands-on knowledge on how to build a simple, end-to-end real-time pipeline with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Apache Spark

#### Suggested readings:
Note: Data, presentations, and code for the exercises will be provided. There is no compulsory reading for the class. 

- I Heart Logs: Event Data, Stream Processing, and Data Integration
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems by Martin Kleppmann(sections)
